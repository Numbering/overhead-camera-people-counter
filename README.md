# people-counter



## Why do it exists?

This repo was created out of the need to explore OpenCV library in order to count people passsing through a door. I based my research on this article http://www.femb.com.mx/people-counter/people-counter-1-installing-python-opencv-and-trying-it-out/ and the [OpenCV API reference](http://docs.opencv.org/3.0-beta/modules/refman.html).
