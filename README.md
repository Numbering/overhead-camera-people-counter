# overhead-camera-people-counter

## Why do it exists?

It was created out of the need to explore OpenCV library in order to count people passsing through a door. I based my research and the code on this article http://www.femb.com.mx/people-counter and the [OpenCV API reference](http://docs.opencv.org/3.0-beta/modules/refman.html).
